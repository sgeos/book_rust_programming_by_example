# Book: Rust Programming By Example

A repository to use while working through the book Rust Programming By Example.

## Notes ##

It might be necessary to tell Rust where the SDL2 libraries have been installed.
For example, add something like this to *~/.profile*.

```sh
# Homebrew Installation
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib"

# MacPorts Installation
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/local/lib"
```
